### INput:
 Users start by entering a task description into the input field. When they click the "Add Task" button, the app processes the input and adds the task to the list. If they want to remove a task, they can simply click the "Delete" button next to it.  

### Process: 
 Tasks are handled by the app in two primary steps. When a user selects "Add Task," the application first records the input, verifies that it isn't empty, and then uses the hook for state management to update the list. Second, the application uses the function to recognize and eliminate a particular task from the list when the user clicks "Delete" on it.  

### Output:
 A real-time display of the updated To-Do list is shown. The application dynamically renders each job on the screen using the  function and includes a "Delete" button for simple removal. This makes task management easy and effective while guaranteeing a seamless and engaging experience.
